## things to improve

**helix**
- [ ] todo/fixme-esque annotation highlights
- [ ] inline error lens
- [ ] enable soft wrap

**zellij**
- [X] create `zj das` alias (i'm an idiot, `zj da` exists -- going to undo the alias)
- [ ] implement plugins (at least the reddit one) in zj tab group
- [ ] create layout file templates
- [ ] figure out how to reattach prev zj session on start (maybe give user a choice between new or reattach on open?)

**yazi**
- [X] add yazi
- [-] configure yazi color theme (pushed some changes but they dont work atm and i'm too lazy to figure out rn)
- [ ] look into terminal-apps.dev on brave and see if yazi is actually the best option
