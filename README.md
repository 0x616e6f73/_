hello, world.


## things to improve

- [X] add yazi
- [-] configure yazi color theme (if any) (pushed some changes but they dont work atm and i'm too lazy to figure out rn)
- [ ] create layout file templates
- [ ] figure out how to reattach prev zj session on start (maybe give user a choice between new or reattach on open?)
- [X] create `zj das` alias (i'm an idiot, `zj da` exists -- going to undo the alias)
